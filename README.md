# bandaid

Bandaid is a tool that lets you connect any Bandcamp username and displayed an enhanced view of your feed. Currently, it sorts albums by number of times they were bought.

## How it works
### Bandaid sorts your Bandcamp feed for you and displays unmissable albums.

1. Load your Bandcamp feed

2. Save albums to your Listen List

3. Buy your favorite ones later
